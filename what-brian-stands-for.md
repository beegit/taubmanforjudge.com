### A Fresh Perspective 
It's time for a new look at how we rehabilitate Lakewood's troubled citizens and its reputation 

### Lifelong northeast Ohio resident 

* Democrat 
* Currently serving as a criminal defense attorney and personal injury attorney at Taubman Law
* Kenyon Graduate 
* Capital Law school passed the bar in 2008
* Worked as a legal aid for a year at Law school and at a prosecutors office for the city of Whitehall Columbus for a brief period of time, giving me the ability to look see the issue from different perspectives 
* Wants to help Lakewood adapt with the times- believes the current judicial system is antiquated and “out of touch” with the issues our legal system faces today

### Main legal objectives 

Take a greater emphasis on helping first-time drug offenders so they don’t become a drug overdose number or evolve into major crimes (e.g. drug court, intense diversionary program, etc.) The ultimate goal would be to implement a drug court program to help first time offenders avoid felonies on their records and getting them the treatment they deserve. Currently Lakewood doesn't offer this program and the system their has given up caring about individual people but instead has become a collection agency where you get lectured, yelled at in a demeaning manner. Below is the program I would to implement. In addition, I would require applicants to meet with me and group that volunteer their time to help people get clean and become upstanding citizens. Not only will a program similar to this help individuals, lower death rates related to heroin and other drug overdoses but it will also decrease the burden tax payers have when a person is incarcerated for an extended period time. 

Giving first-time offenders more opportunities to “get clean” reduces the burden on the system while reducing the offender’s chance of relapse. 

By implementing a drug court program similar to the one being run in Cleveland Drug Court. This program  may be offered to a felony offender charged with a fourth- or fifth-degree-level possession of a controlled substance, who has only one non-violent felony conviction and is chemically-dependent.

Defendants are required to enter a plea of “guilty” to a first-degree misdemeanor. The sentence is held in abeyance pending successful completion of the program. Upon successful completion of Drug Court and payment of a supervision fee, a participant’s guilty plea is vacated, the charge(s) dismissed and the case sealed or expunged.

More than 1,100 people have successfully completed the Greater Cleveland Drug Court Program, which benefits not just the individuals involved, but also the community in which they live and all taxpayers. A program like this would have a great impact in Lakewood and greatly reduce heroin and drug overdoses.

I would make this one of my goals to implement and receive Specialized Docket Certification from the Supreme Court of Ohio. 

There's no guarantee this program will get adopted or support in the first year we implement it but I will work tirelessly to help people get the treatment they deserve so they don't become a statistic or burden on the tax paying citizen. 

I'm mental health certified and have dealt with mental diseases both in my professional and personal life. By recognizing and assessing those with mental health problems and giving them the treatment they need you are giving the mentally sick and/or developmentally disabled offenders the opportunity to remain in the community and function as healthy, law-abiding citizens and to reduce the likelihood that they will come back into the criminal justice system as offenders. Currently nothing like this exists in Lakewood or is even being addressed by the current judge or prosecutors. Brian believes that every person deserves to be treated fairly and have the opportunity to be a law abiding citizen and contribute the community. Programs like this and drug are designed to help individuals and should be implemented in Lakewood either through possible grants or through more dedicated and extra arraignments and pre-trials. A judge who has't gotten stale, a judge with motivation, youth and a desire to help people and the community is what the city of Lakewood needs. 

Coming from a veteran family, Brian understands that veterans need special treatment and promises to assess and treat veterans with the respect they deserve. Clearly every person deserves individualized treatment when they are in front of a Judge. 

Brian believes the current way Lakewood municipal court is operating has given up looking at individual situations and circumstances. Brian will look at individual as an individual with no preconceived thought or opinions. He will not only look at both sides of things, but will find out what led this person here, in front of him today and will promise to help those who want help and those who need help but never forgetting that his true job is protect the citizens of Lakewood. 

Brian has grown up with animals all his life and frequents the Lakewood Dog park regularly. Brian has two German Shepherds, one of which was a rescue, and believes that not only do people need to have their lives and rights protected but so do animals. Brian will put his foot down on all animal related crimes and will be the voice of those who can't speak. 

Upon moving into Lakewood a few years ago, Brian was told to move west of Warren. After living in Lakewood for four plus years and speaking to many concerned citizens, Brian believes that this preconceived notion that these areas of Lakewood, such as Birdtown and west 117th, are unsafe and undesirable is hurting Lakewood and the surrounding areas. Brian will put an emphasis on Cleveland crime crossing over into these areas as well as throughout Lakewood, making sure that those who commit crimes in Lakewood are held responsible and those who may be thinking about committing crimes in Lakewood are persuaded.
