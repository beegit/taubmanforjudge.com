## A campaign letter from Brian Taubman 

Hello there. Thank you for visiting this site. If you're here then you likely share my passion for Lakewood. It is this passion that has led me to run for judge in 2015. Simply put: It's time for a new look at how we rehabilitate Lakewood's troubled citizens and its reputation. 

This November, I'm honored to be on the ballot to be Lakewood Municipal Court Judge. This role is not just a title to me, it's how I want to give my life back to the city I love.  Over the last few years, I've realized Lakewood, the city where I chose to buy a home and build a life, had a court system that was behind the times, refusing to adapt with the population. 

Lakewood Municipal Court has become stagnant. Each case is a number to be processed and pushed through. This is the case in any court room where an incumbent judge runs unopposed after a career in the prosecutor ranks. The daily outlook becomes about dealing out punishment and appearing hard on crime, without understanding individual cases. 

But I am a criminal defense attorney. I understand that the law is important to our safety. I also understand that it can be applied incorrectly or too harshly, leaving in its wake non-violent offenders who lose their ability to rehabilitate. 

I plan to apply the law fairly and in a way that improves the lives of Lakewood citizens. I will not use this position to lecture people or talk down to them. As Judge, I won't sit on pulpit, exacting justice without hearing, understanding and having compassion for the people in front of me.  I will protect our city by ensuring proper punishments are given out for violent crime, hate crime and animal cruelty. I will also protect it by ensuring the first-time drug cases are heard fairly to keep one bad decision from turning our citizens into career criminals. 

### Correcting first-time offenders 
I want to step up and put a greater emphasis on helping non-violent first-time drug offenders so they don’t become a drug overdose number or find themselves as career criminals. 

My ultimate goal is to implement a drug court program to help first-time offenders avoid felonies on their records and get them the treatment they deserve. Currently, Lakewood doesn't offer this program. 

As I was preparing this letter, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner released a report that revealed Lakewood has been hit hard by heroin, leading the Cleveland-area suburbs in heroin deaths with 51 in 2013. In Cuyahoga County in that same year, heroin deaths exceeded deaths by homicides and motor vehicles. 

Once implemented, a drug program will lower death rates related to drug overdoses, increase the number of rehabilitated drug users and decrease the burden on tax payers who are billed for non-violent drug offenders when they are incarcerated for extended periods of time. 

Giving first-time offenders more opportunities to get clean reduces the burden on the system while reducing the offender’s chance of relapse. I am making it my mission to implement a drug court program similar to the one being run in [Cleveland](http://www.cleveland.com/morris/index.ssf/2014/06/the_cuyahoga_county_drug_court.html). This program may be offered to a felony offender charged with a fourth- or fifth-degree-level possession of a controlled substance who has only one non-violent felony conviction and is chemically-dependent.

These are not violent criminals; these are people who have lost their way and can either be brought back or sent down a path to a criminal career. 

In a drug court program, these defendants are required to enter a plea of “guilty” to a first-degree misdemeanor. The sentence is held in abeyance pending successful completion of the program. Upon successful completion of Drug Court and payment of a supervision fee, a participant’s guilty plea is vacated, the charge(s) dismissed and the case sealed or expunged. If they fail to complete the program, these defendants serve out their sentence. 

**More than 1,100 people have successfully completed the Greater Cleveland Drug Court Program, which benefits not just the individuals involved, but also the community in which they live and all taxpayers.** 

A program like this would have a great impact in Lakewood and it is how we can reduce overdoses caused by drug epidemics like heroin. I would make implementing this program and receiving Specialized Docket Certification from the Supreme Court of Ohio one of my primary goals if elected. 

There's no guarantee this program will get adopted immediately, but I will work tirelessly to help people get the treatment they deserve so they don't become a statistic or a burden on the tax-paying citizen. 

### Evaluating cases fairly 
I believe the way Lakewood municipal court is currently operating has given up looking at individual situations and circumstances. I will look at each individual as an individual with no preconceived thought or opinions. I will not only look at both sides of things, but will find out what led this person here, and promise to help those who want help and need help. But while I will push troubled individuals seek help, **I will never forget that my first job is to protect the citizens of Lakewood.** 

What should be clear is that I know from my criminal defense work that every person deserves to have their day in court. That means they need to have a judge who considers their circumstances. 

Coming from a veteran family, I understand that many veterans deal with trauma from their service to our country. I promise to assess and treat veterans with the respect they deserve and evaluate each case individually. 

I'm also certified to handle mental health cases, and have first-hand experience helping those with mental diseases both in my professional and personal life. By recognizing and assessing those with mental health problems and giving them the treatment they need, you give them the opportunity to remain in the community and function as healthy, law-abiding citizens. You are also reducing the likelihood that they will re-enter the criminal justice system as offenders --- or learn crime as a way of life while incarcerated. 

### No more hate 
A person's rights of safety and equality are fundamental. I believe that no one should ever be singled out, physically harmed or mentally intimidated, or be denied housing or basic needs due to their color, race, religion, gender, national origin or sexual orientation. Unfortunately, not every person shares this opinion on equal rights. 

If I'm elected, I promise to look into whether offender's in the court room were motivated by prejudice based on race, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, or religion before sentencing that person. A hate crime is an attack on our community and it will be taken very seriously.

### Protecting people --- and animals 
I've grown up with animals all my life and frequent the Lakewood Dog park. I have two German Shepherds, one of which was a rescue, and believe that not only do people need to have their lives and rights protected, but so do animals. I will put my foot down on all animal-related crimes and will be the voice of those who can't speak. 

### Improving Lakewood's image 
Upon moving into Lakewood a few years ago, I was told to move west of Warren. After living in Lakewood for four-plus years and speaking to many concerned citizens, I believe that the preconceived notion areas of Lakewood, such as Birdtown and West 117th, are unsafe and undesirable is hurting Lakewood's reputation and therefore negatively effecting our small business owners. I will put an emphasis on Cleveland crime crossing over into these areas, making sure that those who commit crimes in Lakewood are held responsible and those who may be thinking about committing crimes in Lakewood think twice. 

### Let's talk
Thanks again for visiting this site. I look forward to earning your vote. I hope to see you at one of our campaign events so we can discuss how we can work together to improve upon the city we call home.
